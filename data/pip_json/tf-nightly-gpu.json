Please install tf-nightly instead.\nThe tf-nightly package supports GPU accelerated operations via Nvidia CUDA.\n\n## Removal Information\n\ntf-nightly and tf-nightly-gpu have been the same package since TensorFlow\n2.1, released in September 2019. Although the checksums differ due to metadata,\nthey were built in the same way and both provide GPU support via Nvidia CUDA.\nAs of January 2023, tf-nightly-gpu has been removed and has been replaced with\nthis new, empty package that generates an error upon installation.\n\nThe TensorFlow team has stopped releasing any new tf-nightly-gpu packages, and\ntf-nightly-gpu packages may disappear at any time. Please switch to tf-nightly.\n\n## About this package\n\nThis simple package raises a warning if setup.py is executed as part of a\npackage installation. This intentionally prevents users from installing\nthe package.\n\nTo build and upload this package's source distribution (sdist) to testpypi:\n\n```\n$ vim setup.cfg  # update the version number and package name\n$ python3 -m pip install --user twine\n$ python3 setup.py sdist\n$ twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*\n$ pip3 install the_name_of_your_test_package -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple\n```\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"home_page":"","keywords":"tensorflow,tensor,machine learning","license":"Apache 2.0","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"tf-nightly-gpu","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-gpu/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-gpu/","project_urls":{"Download":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tags","Homepage":"https://www.tensorflow.org","Issue Tracker":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues"},"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-gpu/2.12.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"Removed: please install \"tf-nightly\" instead.","version":"2.12.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":17845287,"releases":{"2.12.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"5869239cda16e2f0de8da43a610b0304ec3d8cf1c954bfb5375a6046f10704f2","md5":"c73c24b59db2458d4565423182ea3c44","sha256":"fdfa4212d54655b26edc9a7ce95b538bfffca41747db966bf437d9a29e3889cd"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"tf-nightly-gpu-2.12.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"c73c24b59db2458d4565423182ea3c44","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2619,"upload_time":"2023-01-24T22:39:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-01-24T22:39:25.387408Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/58/69/239cda16e2f0de8da43a610b0304ec3d8cf1c954bfb5375a6046f10704f2/tf-nightly-gpu-2.12.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"5869239cda16e2f0de8da43a610b0304ec3d8cf1c954bfb5375a6046f10704f2","md5":"c73c24b59db2458d4565423182ea3c44","sha256":"fdfa4212d54655b26edc9a7ce95b538bfffca41747db966bf437d9a29e3889cd"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"tf-nightly-gpu-2.12.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"c73c24b59db2458d4565423182ea3c44","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2619,"upload_time":"2023-01-24T22:39:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-01-24T22:39:25.387408Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/58/69/239cda16e2f0de8da43a610b0304ec3d8cf1c954bfb5375a6046f10704f2/tf-nightly-gpu-2.12.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
